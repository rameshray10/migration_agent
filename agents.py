agents/agents.py

All 4 CrewAI agents for the migration pipeline.

KEY CHANGES from 0.28.8 → 1.9.3:
  1. LLM:     from crewai import LLM  (NOT langchain_openai.ChatOpenAI)
  2. verbose: True/False only  (NOT 0/1/2)
  3. manager_agent is ONLY for Process.hierarchical — removed from here,
     handled in main.py with Process.sequential

TOKEN OPTIMISATION CHANGES:
  - Manager + Critic now use `fast_model` (gpt-4o-mini by default)
    These agents only read + summarise — they don't generate code.
  - Developer + Tester keep the main model (gpt-4o) for code quality.
  - max_iter reduced on all agents to cap runaway token loops:
      Manager   5 → 3
      Developer 10 → 5
      Tester     8 → 4
      Critic     6 → 3
